<p>Socio-psychological elements including moral and logical considerations were found to the drivers in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or disease occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study performed by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that an absence of certified IPM specialists and extension educators was an impediment for IPM application in developed nations.</p>

<p>A technique that includes the use of pest-tolerant and pest-resistant cultivars established through traditional breeding or genetic engineering (Douglas 2018, Kennedy 2008, Nelson et al. 2018 ). These cultivars have physical, morphological, or biochemical characters that reduce the plant's beauty or viability for the pest to feed, develop, or reproduce successfully.</p>
