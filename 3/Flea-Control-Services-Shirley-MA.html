<p>Socio-psychological elements including moral and logical considerations were found to the drivers in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or disease occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study performed by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that an absence of certified IPM specialists and extension educators was an impediment for IPM application in developed nations.</p>

These cultivars have physical, morphological, or biochemical characters that reduce the plant's beauty or viability for the pest to feed, develop, or reproduce successfully.</p>
