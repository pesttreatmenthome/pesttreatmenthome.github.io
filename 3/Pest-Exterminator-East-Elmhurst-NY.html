The following example describes the six components of an Integrated Pest Management program utilized to manage carpenter ants. Focusing mainly on long-term pest prevention, a successful IPM program utilizes a combination of control methods consisting of biological control, environment adjustment, modifications to cultural practices and use of resistant plant varieties.</p>
<p>Todays professionals utilize Integrated Pest Management techniques which include traps and exemption approaches to control pests. 2Standard Covered Pests include cockroaches, mice, rats, silverfish, "home" ants (leaving out carpenter ants, fire ants, pharaoh ants & tawny insane ants), clothing moths, non-poisonous spiders, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, earwigs, house crickets and paper wasps.</p>
<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a procedure that is used to control pest populations while decreasing the impacts on people and the surrounding environment. Though there is a controversy of utilizing chemicals due to ecological pollution it is a fact that this is the only technique which is commonly accepted and offered effective control of pest.</p>
