<p>If pesticides are necessary, they are picked and applied in such a way that avoids interrupting other IPM practices. Practically every kind of pest positions a threat to the properties they inhabit, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the implementation of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or highly specified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outside environment.</p>
<p>This approach of pest control has actually fallen out of favour in current years because fire eliminates helpful insects together with the pests and can have an unfavorable effect on the soil. To reduce prospective damage to useful insects, restrict your spraying to little locations where you can see pests prowling, and leave a couple of unsprayed "refuges" for any great bugs you can't see.</p>
