The following example explains the six parts of an Integrated Pest Management program used to manage carpenter ants. Focusing primarily on long-lasting pest avoidance, a successful IPM program utilizes a combination of control approaches including biological control, environment manipulation, modifications to cultural practices and usage of resistant plant varieties.</p>
<p>IPM is used in farming, horticulture, forestry, human habitations, preventive conservation and basic pest control, including structural pest management, turf pest management and decorative pest management. Deal with a pest infestation with a hand sprayer, fertilize your turf with a granular spreader, take on termite treatments with a foamer, bait for roaches and ants with a professional bait weapon, or apply pre-emergent herbicides with a knapsack sprayer.</p>
<p>Chemical control is the use of pesticides.

<p>If, after following preventive and organized management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above threshold levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or apply picked biopesticides with low ecological impact. Expert exterminators utilize different kinds of baits and pesticides to kill and get rid of pests.
