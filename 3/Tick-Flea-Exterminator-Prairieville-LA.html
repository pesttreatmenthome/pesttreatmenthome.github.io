<p>By developing an individualized Integrated Pest Management program for your garden, you can take action-- with the ideal controls-- when pests appear, and after that rest easy. Consideration of crop plants as active parts of multitrophic level interactions is essential to a total systems approach to pest management. Commercial pest control companies have responsibilities that go far beyond that of managing and getting rid of pests.</p>

Agriculture takes on the problem with integrated pest management. The term pest" describes more than one reason for problems including diseases, unwanted insects, termites, weeds, mollusks and nematodes. A variety of treatment approaches have been used, including chemical methods, such as pesticide applications and toxic gas fumigations; and non-chemical treatments, such as freezing or heating the materials, the use of micro-waves, gamma radiation, customized environments, and anoxic fumigation.</p>
