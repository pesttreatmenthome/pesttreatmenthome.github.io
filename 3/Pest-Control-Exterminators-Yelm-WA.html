<p>IPM programs work to keep track of for pests and recognize them properly, so that proper control choices can be made in combination with action thresholds. Nevertheless, the significant trend has been towards using modern-day chemistry and molecular biology to replace traditional pesticides with less hazardous chemicals or nontoxic biologically based products; however these methods are still rehabs.</p>
