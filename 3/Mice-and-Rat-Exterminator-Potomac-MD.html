<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Fall is back, and winter is near; thank goodness!. Damage of crop residue: Pupae of insect stays inside the crop residue and can be controlled by damaging it. IPM is practiced to some degree in all agricultural crops, but synthetic pesticides remain a dominant strategy in handling pests. Maybe you're the type to dive in, research study your pest, explore the most efficient control options, and are feeling well prepared to take things on by yourself.</p>
<p>Sunlight Pest Control is a well-established ISO 9001: 2015 licensed company in the region. The products that PCPs utilize against pests are just as reliable but are less toxic to animals and humans.

Bio-rational materials, or pest control products that are fairly non-toxic and have little negative influence on the environment, are another step forward in sustainability and are becoming significantly crucial. Browse by pest to find pesticide items that target common household and garden pests like ants, fleas, cockroaches, lawn weeds and aphids.</p>
