<p>Information on how to handle typical family pests like spiders, insects, cockroaches, mice and ants. Above a particular level of tactical integration, a limit is reached at which a formerly, pesticide-centered program, becomes an IPM system.

<p>The determination of the appropriate cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is necessary in manipulating the environment to the crop's advantage and to the hinderance of the pest.

<p>Consider alternative approaches (aside from pesticides) to make your house and garden unattractive to pests. With IPM, you act to keep pests from ending up being a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can stand up to pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from getting in a building. Recent quests for effective, safe, and lasting pest management programs have been targeted mostly toward development of brand-new and much better items with which to change standard toxic pesticides.</p>
