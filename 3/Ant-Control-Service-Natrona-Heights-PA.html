<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an ecosystem method to crop production and security that combines different management techniques and practices to grow healthy crops and reduce the use of pesticides. By finishing and utilising an IPM strategy, members may be able to save money on pest control approaches which were formerly used and can possibly minimize future problems with pesticide resistance on farm. Because they are usually more efficient and can usually be utilized to control several pests, the majority of insecticides fall into the chemical category. Physical barriers such as fences, internet, mulch, and tree trunk guards can omit pests and decrease the damage they cause.</p>

In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest reliable dose when other approaches of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term avoidance of pests or their damage through a combination of methods such as biological control, habitat manipulation, modification of cultural practices, and usage of resistant ranges.</p>
