The chemical controls are applied just after routine tracking shows that a pest population had reached an economic limit level. Lots of individual product growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to specify what IPM indicates for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are offered in restricted areas.</p>
