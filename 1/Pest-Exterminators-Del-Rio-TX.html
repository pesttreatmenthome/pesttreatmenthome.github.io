Biopesticides are typically compatible with natural opponents, but there are exceptions.</p>
<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with invasive pest concerns, classical biological control approach is normally utilized where natural enemies from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ).
