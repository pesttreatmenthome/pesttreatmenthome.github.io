<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and dissuade pest persistence include intercropping (several crops in the very same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests away from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have actually emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
