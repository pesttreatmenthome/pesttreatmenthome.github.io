Pest control specialists or exterminators help get rid of unwanted visitors from citizens, business buildings, and other public areas such as mice, rats, roaches, bees, spiders, ticks, bed bugs, fleas, termites, along with lots of other kinds of pests. Under IPM, actions are required to control pests just when their numbers are likely to exceed acceptable levels.</p>
