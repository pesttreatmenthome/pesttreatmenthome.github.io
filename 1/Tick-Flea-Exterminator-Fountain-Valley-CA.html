<p>Biological control has actually been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve intrusive pest issues, classical biological control technique is normally utilized where natural enemies from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ).
