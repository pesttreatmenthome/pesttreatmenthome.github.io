<p>The many differing risks from pests make it suggested for cultural heritage companies to establish an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and structures. In these countries, routine use of pesticides is limited to high value (money) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is largely fixated cotton, rice, soybean, and sugarcane.</p>
<p>Typically, the primary goal of IPM programmes is on farming insect pests (IPM Standards, 2009 ). Although, initially developed for farming pest management, IPM programs are now developed to include diseases, weeds, and other pests that may hinder the management objectives of websites such as residential and industrial structures, yard and grass locations, and house and community gardens.</p>
<p>The term "integrated" was thus synonymous with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be applied only after routine monitoring showed that a pest population had reached a level (the financial threshold) that required treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which financial losses would exceed the cost of the control measures.</p>
