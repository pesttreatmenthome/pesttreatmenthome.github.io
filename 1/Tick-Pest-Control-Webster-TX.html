<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, correct watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the environment as an entire and takes into account a balanced mix of the abovementioned control approaches to produce the most efficient and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>The technique to be picked for IPM depends upon many aspects, the crucial of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and financial element of the management. Insect pests cause significant losses to food and fiber crops worldwide. If basic home health is disregarded, the effects of other types of pest control will be incredibly short-term as the pests will quickly be back, and in higher numbers.</p>

<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can rapidly achieve levels at which damage is caused thus ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare).
