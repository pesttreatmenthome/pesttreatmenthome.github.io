<h2>How To Select the Right Pest Control Service in Franklin</h2>
<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Termites are nasty customers. For some jobs, pest control workers use a mix of pest management methods, a practice known as integrated pest management. The cornerstone of a reliable IPM program is a schedule of regular examinations. Crop losses due to illness, arthropods, and weeds, though disputed by some as a legitimate procedure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the surge of pest control.</p>
<p>Some also acknowledged that if regionally coordinated IPM might take place, even yearly management of a continuous pest could be made more effective (Faust and Chandler, 1998). We hire exterminators who concentrate on business or commercial pest control. Constant training and education of farmers represent the cornerstone for establishment of efficient and strong IPM program in agroecosystems.</p>
