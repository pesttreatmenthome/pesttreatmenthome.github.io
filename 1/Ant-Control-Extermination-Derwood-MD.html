For that reason, a simple switch to nontoxic pesticides, such as microbials or inundative releases of natural enemies, although helpful in reducing environmental contamination and safety problems, still does not truly resolve the environmentally based weak point of the standard pest control method.</p>
<p>For example, diesel-powered tractors are run for vacuuming western stained bug in strawberry 2-3 times or more weekly while a pesticide application typically requires using tractor as soon as every 7-14 d. To control specific pests, multiple applications of organic pesticides may be necessary with associated costs and threats, while similar pest populations could be controlled by less chemical pesticide applications.</p>
