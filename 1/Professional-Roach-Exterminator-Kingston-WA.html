<p>The human response depends on the significance of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to efforts to completely get rid of the pest. Recent experiences with insect pest management for cotton in the southeastern United States will be used for crucial examples in the conversation. The term Integrated Pest Management (IPM) describes pest control and prevention programs that rely on numerous synchronised methods to obtain the preferred outcome.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, it is likewise based upon semiochemicals especially allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are driven away or deterred far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are all at once drawn in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or eliminated 35 (Figure 5 ). The majority of pesticide issues are caused by a small number of the pesticides available today.</p>
