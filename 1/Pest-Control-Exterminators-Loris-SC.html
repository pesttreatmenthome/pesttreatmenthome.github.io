<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to invasive pest concerns, classical biological control technique is normally utilized where natural opponents from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and released in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has been efficiently used against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Under this scheme, insect control was "supervised" by qualified entomologists and insecticide applications were based upon conclusions reached from regular tracking of pest and natural-enemy populations.
