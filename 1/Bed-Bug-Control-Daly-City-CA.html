<p>Pests can end up being an expensive problem for your business if delegated their own gadgets. If more tracking, identifications and action thresholds show that less risky controls are not working, then extra pest control techniques would be used, such as targeted spraying of pesticides. However excellent the results of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) may be, it is only reasonable to state that worldwide, its release in farming is still in its infancy, and we are a long way from understanding everything that goes on in and around the crops we grow for food.</p>
<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can rapidly attain levels at which damage is triggered therefore ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare).
