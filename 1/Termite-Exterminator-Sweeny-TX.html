<p>A biological control program can be successful if these suggestions are followed: 1) properly identify all arthropod pests, 2) purchase natural enemies from a trusted biological control supplier, 3) make certain there is a constant supply of high quality natural enemies, 4) highlight that correct shipping procedures be followed, and 5) get directions from biological control suppliers on proper release rates and timing of application.</p>
<p>Naturally, you could keep the crop covered for its whole life span, although this isn't a great alternative for crops that need insect pollination.
