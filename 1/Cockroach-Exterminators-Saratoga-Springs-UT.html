Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simple definition of IPM - they see IPM as being practically exclusively about lowering pesticide usage.

<h3>Pest Control - What Are Pest Repellent Plants Saratoga Springs UT</h3>
<p>This approach describes using a range of physical or mechanical strategies for pest exclusion, trapping (sometimes comparable to the behavioral control), removal, or damage (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exemption with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to get rid of pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, modifying ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, visual or physical bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
<p>This may include the use of numerous pesticides with various modes of action. Trap crops are planted to attract and hold pest insects where they can be handled more efficiently and prevent or reduce their motion onto important crops. Schedules are used to classify pesticides and to control the availability of a product to the public. Termites need wetness for their survival, hence wet walls, leakage and water seepage resemble open invites for them.</p>
