Socio-psychological elements including moral and logical considerations were found to the motorists in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or disease occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that a lack of qualified IPM experts and extension teachers was an obstacle for IPM implementation in industrialized countries.</p>
