<p>Socio-psychological factors consisting of ethical and rational factors to consider were discovered to the chauffeurs in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of veggie growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or disease occurrence and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that a lack of certified IPM professionals and extension educators was an impediment for IPM execution in developed nations.</p>
<p>The approach to be chosen for IPM depends upon lots of aspects, the important of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and financial aspect of the management.
