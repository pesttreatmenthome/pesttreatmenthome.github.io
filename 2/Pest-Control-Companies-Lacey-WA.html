To deplore an effective IPM programme, literature and other information sources about the pest, the pest's life process, host variety, circulation, movement, and fundamental biology will have to be researched.</p>
<p>There are two different types of pest control services. Cultural controls are practices that reduce pest facility, dispersal, recreation, and survival.
