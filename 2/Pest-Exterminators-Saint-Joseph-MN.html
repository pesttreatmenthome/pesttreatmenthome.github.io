<p>For instance, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Study Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making procedure that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to recognize, manage, and decrease threat from pests and pest management tools and methods in a way that decreases overall economic, health, and environmental threats.</p>
<p>The decision of the correct reason for pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in controling the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides harmful to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural opponents than products that are selective or narrow-spectrum for specific insect species or life phases.</p>
