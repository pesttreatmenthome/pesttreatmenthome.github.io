<p>There is no clear clinical evidence that taking in crop products originated from genetically engineered plants has caused damaging effects to animals or people (e.g., 75% of all cheeses consist of chymosin, which is, and has actually been for some time, produced with genetically crafted germs). In lots of establishing nations, where IPM is now governmental policy, pesticide use is being lowered.</p>
<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal dosages of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience retarded development and feeding and are subject to higher parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ).
