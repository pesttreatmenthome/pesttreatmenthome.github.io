D's has been my only option for over 15 years for pest and weed control in addition to fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in farming arising from an overuse of synthetic pesticides.</p>
<p>By establishing a customized Integrated Pest Management program for your garden, you can act-- with the ideal controls-- when pests appear, and after that rest easy.

Most scientists concur that this will be possible just if we cultivate crops according to the idea of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).</p>
<p>A strategy that includes using pest-tolerant and pest-resistant cultivars developed through conventional breeding or genetic modification (Douglas 2018, Kennedy 2008, Nelson et al. 2018 ). These cultivars have physical, morphological, or biochemical characters that reduce the plant's attractiveness or suitability for the pest to feed, develop, or replicate successfully.</p>

Our very own skilled and well-trained exterminators carry out the basic pest control to accomplish 100% client complete satisfaction. A 2006 United States Geological Study evaluation of 51 studies over 10 years reported that 96% of fish, 100% of surface water, and 33% of major aquifers tested from 1992 to 2001 consisted of one or more pesticides.</p>
