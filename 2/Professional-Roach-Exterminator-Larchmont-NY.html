<p>In New York City, cockroaches are nearly a way of living. Common pests include roaches, rats, mice, spiders, termites, ants, and insects. To assist you brainstorm prospective business names, let's take a look at three successful pest control businesses and break down why and how they have actually selected to call their business and why it works for them. Conduct evaluations of your business' exterior on a regular basis, making certain you seal any cracks and crevices that might end up being entry points for pests.</p>
<p>Part of this success originated from field schools which allowed regional farmers to harness their native understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997).
