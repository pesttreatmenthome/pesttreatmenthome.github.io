To deplore an effective IPM programme, literature and other data sources about the pest, the pest's life process, host variety, circulation, motion, and fundamental biology will need to be investigated.</p>
<p>IPM methods include both chemical and nonchemical ways to prevent and control pest populations from reaching financially destructive levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest efficient dose when other methods of pest control have stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term avoidance of pests or their damage through a combination of strategies such as biological control, environment manipulation, adjustment of cultural practices, and usage of resistant varieties.</p>
