<h3>Organic Garden Pest Control Dayton TN</h3>
<p>Worldwide, more than 500 types of termites, spiders, and insects have developed some level of pesticide resistance. Pesticides can take the form of a strong, liquid, powder or spray. Trap crops: Some cotton pests prefer crops like maize, sunflower, okra (lady finger), sorghum, pigeon pea or hibiscus to cotton. IPM sees your garden and its pests as part of a larger environment and handles both with the big photo in mind.</p>
