Evaluation previous pest problems and present pesticide application techniques and make a note of crops growing in surrounding greenhouses or outdoors.</p>
<p>IPM methods consist of both chemical and nonchemical means to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest effective dose when other techniques of pest control have actually stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based method that concentrates on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a mix of methods such as biological control, habitat adjustment, adjustment of cultural practices, and use of resistant ranges.</p>
<p>The human response depends on the value of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to completely remove the pest. Recent experiences with bug pest management for cotton in the southeastern United States will be utilized for crucial examples in the discussion. The term Integrated Pest Management (IPM) describes pest control and prevention programs that depend on a number of simultaneous methods to obtain the wanted result.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic food production applies much of the very same ideas as IPM but limits the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to minimize the need for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
