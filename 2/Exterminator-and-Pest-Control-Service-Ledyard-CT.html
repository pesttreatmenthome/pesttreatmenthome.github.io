Pests can be eliminated from plants physically. Synthetic or conventional pesticides: IPM programs consist of pesticides produced from artificial active ingredients.</p>
<p>The decision of the proper reason for pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is necessary in controling the environment to the crop's benefit and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides toxic to many insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural enemies than products that are selective or narrow-spectrum for specific insect species or life stages.</p>

Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling use fossil fuels and indirectly have a negative impact on the environment.</p>
