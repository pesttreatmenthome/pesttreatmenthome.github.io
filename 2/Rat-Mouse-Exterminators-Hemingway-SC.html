<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the environment as an entire and thinks about a balanced mix of the previously mentioned control approaches to produce the most reliable and least damaging plan.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that of their possible damage to pest control workers, clients, and the environment, restricted-use pesticides are heavily controlled by Federal law. Fungus: Beauveria bassiana is used for control of lepidopterous pests. The interactions in between crop and pest (as well as the environment) are really important. Promotion of natural opponents: Not utilizing pesticides and diversifying crops benefits natural opponents of cotton pests such as birds, ladybirds, beetles, spiders, parasitic wasps, bugs and ants.</p>
<p>Secondly, the best pest control brand names will not leave a single bed bug behind. But when the regular natural disinfectants and keeping the home clean is no longer reliable then it is a good idea to take professional help. Preventive practices are necessary part of an IPM program.
