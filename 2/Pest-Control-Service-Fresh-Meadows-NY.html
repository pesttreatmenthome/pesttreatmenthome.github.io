<h3>Pest Control At Home Fresh Meadows NY 11365</h3>
<p>The 4 significant issues encountered with standard pesticides are harmful residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest revival (Lewis, 1997 ). The use of natural pesticides and organophosphates that are more environmentally friendly are urged and synthetic pesticides should only be used as a last hope or only used as needed and often just at particular times in a pests life process.</p>
<p>These unknown or badly understood prospective dangers argue for extra levels of security including exposures to several pesticides, in your home, at school and in the diet; direct exposure to chemicals in combination with pesticides such as pharmaceuticals, industrial compounds and personal care items; and the basic trouble in associating persistent diseases to any one specific cause.</p>
