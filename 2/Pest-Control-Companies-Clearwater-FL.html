<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Study Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to determine, manage, and lower threat from pests and pest management tools and techniques in such a way that reduces overall economic, health, and environmental threats.</p>
<p>In recommendation to the idea of integrating the use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later broadened to embrace coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess higher levels of resistance.</p>
